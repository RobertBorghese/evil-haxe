Evil Haxe v1 was an [opinionated edit of the Haxe compiler](https://github.com/SumRndmDde/evil-haxe) I made about a year ago. It's a superset of Haxe that is created to add as many modern and cool features the language can possibly contain without completely breaking compatibility with vanilla Haxe. It was summoned from an alternative universe using a demonic ritual, and it continues to eat away at my soul from the darkest depths of our world.

Version 1.0 was just a collection of Haxe mods I made for fun. However with version 2.0, I want to try and make the project more accessible to others. To do this, I will:
* Keep all changes modular and allow features to be enabled/disabled like Babel/TypeScript.
* Create a compile-time Haxe API for making parser mods and use it to implement the majority of the mods.
* Enforce a header syntax to enable Evil Haxe in Haxe source files. This'll help mark code intended to be used with Evil Haxe vs normal Haxe to avoid confusion when reading source code.
* Branch from the latest stable release (post v5.0 release). This should prevent constant, annoying maintenence to keep things compatible with the development branch.

Anyway, just setting this repo up to work on whenever I'm bored. Don't expect any progress for a while lool.
